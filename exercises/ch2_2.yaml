          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is the law of the excluded middle: it cannot be both warm and cold. The structure of the argument is A. Therefore, not (not A)."
        - prompt: "It is sunny. It is warm. Therefore, it is sunny and warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is the definition of and."
        - prompt: "It is warm. Therefore, it is sunny or it is warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "A or B is true if either A is true or B is true (or both)."
        - prompt: "It is sunny or it is warm. It is cold. Therefore, it is sunny."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is of the form A or B. Not B. Therefore, A. It is an example of denying the disjunct."
        - prompt: "If it is sunny then it is warm. It is sunny. Therefore, it is warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is an example of affirming the precedent, modus ponendo ponens."
        - prompt: "If it is sunny then it is warm. It is not warm. Therefore, it is not sunny."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is an example of denying the consequent, modus tollendo tollens."
        - prompt: "It is not sunny or warm. Therefore, it is not sunny and it is not warm."

          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is one of de Morgan's Laws."
        - prompt: "It is not sunny and warm. Therefore, it is not sunny or it is not warm."

          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is one of de Morgan's Laws."
        - prompt: "It is sunny or not warm. It is warm. Therefore, it is sunny."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is of the form A or B. Not B. Therefore, A, where B is 'not warm'. The argument is an example of denying the disjunct."
        - prompt: "It is not sunny or warm. Therefore, it is not warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is one of de Morgan's Laws."

          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Fallacious
          explanation: "This is an example of affirming the disjunct."
        - prompt: "It is not sunny and warm. Therefore, it is not warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Fallacious
          explanation: "This is an example of denying the conjunct."
        - prompt: "If it is sunny then it is warm. It is not sunny. Therefore, it is not warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Fallacious
          explanation: "This is an example of denying the antecedent."
        - prompt: "If it is sunny then it is warm. It is warm. Therefore, it is sunny."

          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Fallacious
          explanation: "This is an example of affirming the consequent."
        - prompt: "It is not sunny and warm. Therefore, it is not sunny and it is not warm."
          type: button
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Fallacious
          explanation: "This is related to denying the conjunct. We know that not both A and B are true. Both could be false, but it is also possible that exactly one of them is true."
        - prompt: "If it is sunny then it is warm. It is dry. Therefore, it is sunny."
