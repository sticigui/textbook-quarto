  exercises:
    - question: "Answer the following logic problems with mixed randomization."
      inputs:
        - prompt: "A. Therefore, not (not A)."
          type: button
          random: true  # This input will have randomized choices
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is the definition of 'not.'"
        - prompt: "A. B. Therefore, A and B."
          type: button
          # No random property - choices will not be randomized
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "This is the definition of 'and.'"
        - prompt: "B. Therefore, A or B."
          type: button
          random: true  # This input will have randomized choices
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "A or B is true if A is true, if B is true and if both A and B are true."
        - prompt: "A or B. Not B. Therefore, A."
          type: button
          # No random property - choices will not be randomized
          choices: [Valid, Fallacious]
          answer: Valid
          explanation: "If either A or B is true, and B is not true, A must be true."
