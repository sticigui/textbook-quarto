## How to use these materials

You are probably using either [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org), [Google
Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), [Internet
Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/ie/),
[Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/), or
[Opera](http://www.opera.com) to view these materials. Those are the most
popular web browsers. To use all the features of SticiGui©, you need an
up-to-date browser that supports frames, cascading style sheets (CSS), HTML
4.01, and JavaScript 1.8. JavaScript must be enabled in the browser; for
assignments to work, the browser must also accept cookies from the originating
server. For a variety of reasons, I strongly recommend that you use Firefox and
that you not use Internet Explorer. Recent versions of Chrome, Safari and Opera
also work—mostly. The materials have been tested most thoroughly with Firefox.

A *link* is a piece of text you can "click" to see another document. You place
the cursor over the link, then push the mouse button (left mouse button on a PC
compatible computer) to "follow" the link. Links in these materials are
generally in blue type.

Clicking a link can either replace the document in one of the frames you are
viewing (not always the frame that has the link), or open a new window that
displays the new document. If you have not changed the default settings in your
browser, links to the glossary will be in green type; those take you to the
right place in the glossary in the bottom frame, so that you don't lose your
place in the book when you look up a term. Links to other materials are in blue
type; those typically replace the contents of the frame you are reading.

You should familiarize yourself with how your browser works to learn to navigate
among windows. On the right side of the browser window, you should see a scroll
bar. If there is a scrollbar, that means there is more to see—drag the slider
down to see more of the text. On some computers, there is a "page down" button
you can click to see the next screenful of text.

In the assignments, the navigation buttons are suppressed to leave more room on
the screen for text and graphics. You can still get a "pop-up menu" that will
allow you to go back to the previous document. How you get the menu depends on
the browser and the operating system. In Microsoft Windows, you get the pop-up
menu by right-clicking in the open browser window. Most browsers have the
ability to search within a document to find a word or phrase within a page. You
might find that feature useful to search for a word in the [glossary](gloss.htm)
or a chapter of the text.

There are graphical [data analysis and visualization
tools](../../Java/Html/index.htm) throughout the text and assignments. Every
chapter has exercises to check your understanding. I strongly recommend that you
do all of them. Most of the exercises call for an answer in a box. After you
type in your answer, strike the "return" or "enter" key. The symbol next to the
question will change from a question mark ![](Graphics/answer_unknown.gif)
either to a green check ![](Graphics/answer_good.gif) (if your answer is right)
or to a red X ![](Graphics/answer_bad.gif) (if your answer is wrong).

Multiple-choice questions automatically show the green check or red X when you
select an answer. Multiple-multiple-choice questions ("select all that apply")
are followed by a button you can click to check your answer. Clicking the mark
after the question (the question mark, check, or X) will expand a box containing
the correct answer, if you have already attempted the problem. You can answer
each question as many times as you like, or see the correct answer. More
detailed solutions to some of the exercises are available too; there is a link
to the detailed answers after those questions. Your answers to the exercises in
the text are not recorded, and the exercises do not contribute to your grade.
Many of the problems are generated randomly—reloading or revisiting the page
will give you a new set of problems, so you can get unlimited practice.

Most of the chapters have a corresponding [assignment](../Problems/index.htm)
covering the material in the chapter. The assignments are graded by a computer,
and may contribute to your grade (your instructor will tell you). Be sure to
click the button labeled "Submit for Grading" after you answer the questions in
each assignment. After the due date of the problem set, you can [see your
score](../Problems/index.htm) by filling out a form. You can also see the
solutions after the due date by returning to the assignment. For [detailed
instructions about the assignments](../Problems/index.htm#general_instructions),
including browser-related issues, see the [homework
homepage](../Problems/index.htm).
